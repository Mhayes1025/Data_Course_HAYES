Final Project Idea: Sleep Quality and Immune Response

For my final project, I will analyze the relationship between sleep quality and immune
response in humans. Sleep is known to play an important role in maintaining immune
function, but many people do not prioritize sleep in daily life. This project will explore
whether individuals who report better sleep quality tend to experience fewer sick days,
which can serve as a simple indicator of immune health.

The data for this project will include individual-level measurements such as sleep duration,
self-reported sleep quality, and number of sick days over a recent time period. If real data
are not available, I will use a simulated dataset that reflects realistic biological trends
based on existing literature.

The dataset will include the following variables:
- Subject ID
- Average sleep hours per night
- Sleep quality score (on a scale of 1 to 10)
- Number of sick days in the past 30 days

Potential sources for real data could include publicly available health surveys, sleep studies,
or clinical research databases. In this assignment, I will use simulated data that mimic
expected patterns, such as higher sleep quality being associated with fewer sick days.

The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between sleep quality and immune
health and to use basic statistical analysis to evaluate whether sleep quality is a meaningful
predictor of immune response.
